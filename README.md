When I was learning coding in C, I made this as a final project of school subject "Linguagem de Programação" - UTFPR in 2019

Was ask to make a game, any kind of game, totally made with C in CodeBlocks.
The game that has been chosen was classic Tetris.

So i'm commiting this repository here, because I'm really proud
of what me and my project partner Juliano were able to do using only the basics of C.

I don't know how to run this on Visual Studio Code, but I'm still commiting this just to not to lose everything we made.

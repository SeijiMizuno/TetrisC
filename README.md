Hi, I'm starting to code and this repository is the final project of
school subject "Linguagem de Programação" - UTFPR

Was ask to make a game, any kind of game, totally made with C and CodeBlocks.
The game that has been chosen was classic Tetris.

So i'm commiting this repository here, because I need to clean my computer and I'm really proud
of what me and my project partner Juliano were able to do using only the basics of C.

I don't know how to run this on Visual Studio Code, but I'm still commiting this just to not to lose everything we made.
